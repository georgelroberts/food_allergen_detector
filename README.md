<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims to, given either (or both) description of a dish or an image of said dish, detect whether or not it contains certain allergens.
This starts with just gluten, but will hopefully expand to other allergens.

## Prerequisites

Please find the packages in requirements.txt

## Datasets

The initial dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/pes12017000148/food-ingredients-and-recipe-dataset-with-images. 
This contains 13,582 food images, along with an ingredient dish and a description of the dish. 
There is also a dataset AIFood that contains 370,000 food images, however this appears to not be publically available.
